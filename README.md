## Special thanks to 🥰:

- [Lucas Amparo](https://github.com/lucasamparo), my tutor at my Scientific Experience at SENAI CIMATEC.
- [Lucianos Oliveira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucianoreboucas/) my teacher at Advanced Mechatronics Topics IV.

## About 🤔:

This repository serves as a dedicated space to house my studies in the field of computer vision and deep learning. Its primary purpose is to store the materials I've developed, which are related to the Computer Vision course at SENAI CIMATEC. This coursework involves programming in C and C++ using OpenCV. Additionally, it includes my projects from the Advanced Mechatronics Topics IV course at UFBA in the 2023.2 semester. This course focuses on image processing and pattern recognition using deep learning techniques.

## Resourses 🧑‍🔬:

- [Pattern recognition in images](https://github.com/FernandoSchett/cv_studies/tree/main/pattern_recognition), a set of material aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for practical laboratory activities in the the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition field.
- [Computer vision course]().
