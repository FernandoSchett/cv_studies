## About 🤔:

This repository serves as a dedicated space to house my studies in the field of computer vision and deep learning. Its primary purpose is to store the materials I've developed, which are related to the Computer Vision course at SENAI CIMATEC. This coursework involves programming in C and C++ using OpenCV. Additionally, it includes my projects from the Advanced Mechatronics Topics IV course at UFBA in the 2023.2 semester. This course focuses on image processing and pattern recognition using deep learning techniques.

## Resourses 🧑‍🔬:

- Pattern Recoggnition
- 


## Results 📈:

## Dependencies 🚚:

The project dependencies are described in  ```./dependencies/requirements.``` within the repository. In summary, heres what you're gonna need in order to run the project:

- [```dependencie <version>```](http:link.com).
- 

For installing dependencies more quickly, you can run the following command at terminal, inside the clonned repository:

	sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    pip3 install -r ./dependencies/requirements.txt

Make sure you have all Dependencies before running the project.

## How to run codes from here 🏃:

First, clone this repository. In the top of each code file, has a manual with instructions for compiling, running, it's porpouse and other information. They usually look like the template below:

	File:           file_name.ext
	Last changed:   xx/xx/20xx xx:xx
	Purpose:        Code for hard problems         
	Authors:        Fernando Antonio Marques Schettini   
	Usage: 
		HowToCompile:   gcc file_name.cpp -o file_name
		HowToExecute:   ./file_name           
	*/ 

### Tools Used 🛠️:
