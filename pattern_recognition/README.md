## About 🤔:

My practices from the Advanced Mechatronics Topics IV course at UFBA in the 2023.2 semester. This course focuses on image processing and pattern recognition using deep learning techniques. Fell free to check out the results reports at [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F-Nw7-t1BPtgF_CaDAa4xPIeDPsNzzenGKaPsVfX59E/edit?usp=sharing) link.

## Resourses 🧑‍🔬:

- Image preprocessing, check out all at [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Jz18rqn5rmZc3P3cgSwTJR4RhUqF62wa?usp=sharing) link.
- Color, Texture and form dataset features extraction.
- Laboratory Practices Report with Methodology and Conclusion of Results.

## Results 📈:

## Dependencies 🚚:

The project dependencies are described in  ```./dependencies/requirements.``` within the repository. In summary, heres what you're gonna need in order to run the project:

- [```dependencie <version>```](http:link.com).
- 

For installing dependencies more quickly, you can run the following command at terminal, inside the clonned repository:

	sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    pip3 install -r ./dependencies/requirements.txt

Make sure you have all Dependencies before running the project.

## How to run codes from here 🏃:

First, clone this repository. In the top of each code file, has a manual with instructions for compiling, running, it's porpouse and other information. They usually look like the template below:

	"""
	File:           file_name.ext
	Last changed:   xx/xx/20xx xx:xx
	Purpose:        Code for hard problems         
	Authors:        Fernando Antonio Marques Schettini   
	Usage: 
		HowToCompile:   gcc file_name.cpp -o file_name
		HowToExecute:   ./file_name           
	Dependecies:
		numpy
	"""

### Tools Used 🛠️: 

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).
- [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/).

For installing some tools more quickly, you can run the following command at terminal, inside the clonned repository:

    sh ./dependencies/install_tools.sh
